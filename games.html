        <p>We have a lot of games to choose from. To make it easier to dive into games you aren’t
          familiar with, we’ve developed a complexity scale, so you know what to expect when you open the box. Each starburst represents an additional level of complexity, from a simple, easyto-learn Level 1 game all the way to a “put your damn phone
          down, there are still 10 pages left” Level 6 game. More complex games aren’t necessarily longer, just more involved. If you’re on the fence, our servers are always happy to help you decide!</p>

              to claim North American railway routes; lon-ger routes earn more points. Points are also earned by completing destination tickets and by having the longest continuous train. Simple enough, but the need to balance greed and fear of
              missing out make this a strategic and rewarding title.</td>
